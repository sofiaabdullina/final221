        <p>The <a href="https://data.nysed.gov/gradrate.php?year=2022&county=42" target="_blank"> New York State Education Department</a> reveals data in which in the cohort years of 2018-2022, economically disadvantaged high school students in Onondaga County, New York are less likely to graduate and are more likely to drop out than their not economically disadvantaged peers.

        <p> Out of 2,909 not economically disadvantaged students, 2,749 students graduated from high school, or 94%. However, out of 2,440 economically disadvantaged students, 1,809 graduated from high school, or 74%. This 20% difference indicates that there could possibly be a correlation between socioeconomic status and graduation rate in Onondaga County.</p>
        <p>Syracuse University elementary and special education student Addie Antshel grew up in Fayetteville, New York, a suburb of Onondaga County. Antshel remembers the overall high school dropout rate to be low in her town, especially when compared to that of Syracuse City public high schools. </p>
        <p>“Looking back now after coming to college, I once thought that it was a very diverse school, but now that I am learning about actual diverse schools, I can see how it’s not so diverse,” Antshel said. “But it was a very academic focused school. There was always this pressure in high school, take as many APs as you can, be an honors student.”</p>
        <p>Last year, Antshel volunteered at Nottingham High School in Syracuse, New York, where she spent time mentoring high school students. Antshel found that many of her students’ main struggles were balancing work, home, and social life. As she reflects on her high school experience, Antshel realizes how it was completely different from that of her students.</p>
        <p>“When I went home from school, I would do my homework, I would see my family, my parents had well enough paying jobs where I didn’t have to have a job that helped out my family,” Antshel said. “But I know for some people that’s not the case, I think definitely for people who are economically disadvantaged, school just might not be for them.”</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, when Antshel asked her students what their plans were for after high school, many said that they were wanted to attend college. Antshel mentions the <a href= "https://sayyessyracuse.org/" target="_blank">“Say Yes to Education” </a>Syracuse program, that many students choose to participate in. 
         <p>According to the orgranization’s website, “Say Yes helps Syracuse City School District and Syracuse charter school students and their families prepare for college and afford its expense, setting our new generation up for a successful future with financial independence.”</p>   
         <p>Additionally, the Say Yes to Education program offers internships to students that they could apply to their future when it comes to education. This could motivate students to graduate from high school, and pursue a college degree. </p>
        <p> Through this program, Syracuse students will have the opprtunity to attend Syracuse University, regardless of financial limitations.</p>
        <p>Racial identity in Onondaga County is another population characteristic that seems to indicate a correlation with graduation rate. For example, out of 3,464 white students, 3,087 graduated, or 89%. However, out of 201 multiracial students, 149 students graduated, or 74%. This 15% difference shows how minorities may have a lower chance of graduating high school in Onondaga County.</p>
        <p>Academic counselor at Syracuse University’s David B. Falk College of Sport and Human Dynamics, Amy Friers, grew up in Onondaga County. Friers is a first generation American as well as college student, and states that her school system encouraged her to attend college.</p>

        <p>“Growing up here a long time ago, it was primarily white, and I really think my family was really lucky to live in the district, because I had different opportunities than some other kids in Syracuse City had,” Friers said.</p>
        <p>Friers explains that the school district that she attended growing up was one of the first to have Promethean boards in their classrooms, which were used to write on in class.</p>
        <p>“It wasn’t until later on when I was really studying education as a college student, and experiencing and meeting people from a lot of different backgrounds that I realized woah- I am really fortunate, I had a lot of privilege growing up that I didn’t realize I had,” Friers said.</p>
        <p>Before she was an academic counselor at Falk, Friers worked for Higher Education Opportunity Program (HEOP) and Student Support Services (SSS), which are organizations that help first generation and minority college students. Programs like HEOP and SSS allow college students to become more acclimated to college life, and show high school students that they have support.</p>
        <p>Although many students in Onondaga County have the access to resources and the ability to graduate from high school, there are still some that are limited to what they can do based on their population characteristics. Whether it be financial disadvantages or racial disparity, American education systems are failing students in living in Onondaga County, as they contribute to overall inequality between population characteristics. </p>
